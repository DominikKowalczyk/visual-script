# Project Roadmap: Creating a New Programming Language for Web Development

## Step 1: Define Objectives and Scope
- **Objectives:**
  - **Simplicity:** Prioritize a simple and straightforward syntax.
  - **Performance:** Aim for efficient execution without sacrificing simplicity.
  - **Ease of Use:** Design with developer-friendly features.
  - **Web Development Focus:** Integrate features tailored for web development.

## Step 2: Research Existing Languages and Tools
- Research strengths and weaknesses of languages like JavaScript, Python, and Ruby.
- Identify unique features contributing to their success, especially in web development.

## Step 3: Language Design Principles
- **Design Principles:**
  - **Expressiveness:** Allow clear and concise expression of intent.
  - **Readability:** Prioritize code readability for collaboration.
  - **Consistency:** Maintain consistent syntax and naming conventions.

## Step 4: Target Web Technologies
- **Web Technologies:**
  - **Server-Side and Client-Side:** Support both for versatility.
  - **Web Frameworks:** Integrate seamlessly with popular frameworks.

## Step 5: Develop a Prototype
- Create a basic prototype focusing on chosen design principles.
- Keep code simple and functional for testing core concepts.

```rust
// Example code in your new language
fn main() {
    let greeting = "Hello, Web!";
    println(greeting);
}
```

## Step 6: Compiler or Interpreter
- **Decision:** Start with an interpreter for faster development and iteration.
- Evaluate the need for a compiler as the language matures.

## Step 7: Tools and Ecosystem
- **Initial Tools:**
  - **Interpreter:** Develop a basic interpreter.
  - **Package Manager:** Create a minimal package manager.
  - **Documentation Generator:** Implement a simple generator.
- **Community Contribution:** Encourage contributions via Git and platforms like GitHub.

## Step 8: Testing and Debugging
- **Testing Tools:**
  - Implement a basic testing framework for unit testing.
  - Develop debugging utilities with clear error messages.

## Step 9: Community Engagement
- Create communication channels (forums, chat rooms) to foster collaboration.
- Actively seek and listen to feedback from early adopters.

## Step 10: Documentation and Tutorials
- Craft comprehensive documentation and tutorials alongside development.
- Keep documentation up-to-date as the language evolves.
